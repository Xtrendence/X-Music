# X:/Music

X:/Music is a Node.js based music player for desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

### How's it different from any other music player?

The default music players of different operating systems are entirely different from one another, whereas X:/Music is identical on all platforms, and also has a web interface for other devices on the same network, so you can control your media from anywhere in your house using your phone or any other device with access to the web.

### Can I import my existing music library?

Yes, you can. Through X:/Music's settings, you can change the location of your music library to wherever your current one is. You won't be able to import playlists (this feature might be added in the future) or any ratings. X:/Music simply searches the entire directory and its subdirectories for MP3, WAV, and OGG files, so you can easily add new songs and move around your library by simply dropping files that have the same type as the three aforementioned ones, and it'll automatically get added to your music library.
